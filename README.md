I am making this "Icon Workshop" online store with an admin panel. I am making an online store based on the Angular 9 + Material Design framework. The backend is a Firebase database. Here it is in test mode https://angular-blog-b9ec2.web.app/. At the moment I am setting up a backend on Node js MySQL.
You can check how the admin panel works by path:
http://localhost:4200/admin
login: test@gmail.com
password: 123456789
